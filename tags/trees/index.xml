      <description>Hello folks ðŸ‘‹
Another week has come and passed. It means that it is time for another article, yay!
Do you remember the article about Fenwick tree? If don&amp;rsquo;t then, please, revisit it before starting with this one.
During that article I mentioned an interesting data structure called Segment Tree. Unfortunately, I did not share any details about it.
Note: also, there is another interesting data structure that can help us to achieve t_he same result.</description>

      <description>Wow! It&amp;rsquo;s been another week from the time when I wrote the previous article about grokking algorithms. The time is passing so fast I barely can see it!
Today I want to introduce a new concept to you - Ternary Search Tree (aka TST). You may already have heard about Binary Search Tree (aka BST) and this idea is pretty similar. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if you did not hear about BST or any trees at all before, TST is pretty easy to understand and you will quickly nail it!</description>
