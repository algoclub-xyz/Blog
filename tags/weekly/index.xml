      <description>Wow! It&amp;rsquo;s been another week from the time when I wrote the previous article about grokking algorithms. The time is passing so fast I barely can see it!
Today I want to introduce a new concept to you - Ternary Search Tree (aka TST). You may already have heard about Binary Search Tree (aka BST) and this idea is pretty similar. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if you did not hear about BST or any trees at all before, TST is pretty easy to understand and you will quickly nail it!</description>

      <description>You may wonder, &amp;ldquo;Fenwick what? Which tree???&amp;rdquo;. Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid of the spooky term the idea is pretty innocent. Remember: fear is the path to the dark side.
First of all, let&amp;rsquo;s start with a simple problem:
Imagine you have an array a of integers of length n. For the sake of simplicity let&amp;rsquo;s assume it is a one-dimensional array.
You are given 2 values start and finish and your goal is to find a sum of all elements in this array between start and finish.</description>
