      <description>Hello folks 👋
Glad to see you reading this article again! Today we&amp;rsquo;re gonna talk about problems in graphs.
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the problem below.
Imagine we have an edge-weighted undirected graph consisting of a few nodes. Our target is to find a minimum spanning tree in this graph.
Minimum spanning tree is an undirected subgraph that contains all the vertices without cycles and with a minimum edges weight.</description>

      <description>Hello folks 👋
Another week has come and passed. It means that it is time for another article, yay!
Do you remember the article about Fenwick tree? If don&amp;rsquo;t then, please, revisit it before starting with this one.
During that article I mentioned an interesting data structure called Segment Tree. Unfortunately, I did not share any details about it.
Note: also, there is another interesting data structure that can help us to achieve t_he same result.</description>

      <description>Hey folks 👋
I know it has been a long time since we&amp;rsquo;ve published the last article. We are really sorry for this delay! Let us do not beat around the bush and jump straight to the discussion topic: pattern matching.
Have you ever caught yourself wondering, &amp;ldquo;I have some text and I want to find a string in it. How can I do it?&amp;rdquo;
Luckily, I have an answer for this question.</description>

      <title>Thirty seconds over Ternary Search tree</title>

      <description>Wow! It&amp;rsquo;s been another week from the time when I wrote the previous article about grokking algorithms. The time is passing so fast I barely can see it!
Today I want to introduce a new concept to you - Ternary Search Tree (aka TST). You may already have heard about Binary Search Tree (aka BST) and this idea is pretty similar. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if you did not hear about BST or any trees at all before, TST is pretty easy to understand and you will quickly nail it!</description>

      <title>Blur, blur, and one more time blur</title>

      <description>Did you ever think what is blur exactly? Generally, the blur means something unclear or something that is hard to see. We can see blur (as an effect) everywhere: you can see the similar effect looking through frosted glass, or just looking on the street through a window in a raining day drinking coffee and feeling blue just for nothing. You can also see blur in so many applications and video games.</description>

      <title>A fish called Fenwick tree</title>

      <description>You may wonder, &amp;ldquo;Fenwick what? Which tree???&amp;rdquo;. Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid of the spooky term the idea is pretty innocent. Remember: fear is the path to the dark side.
First of all, let&amp;rsquo;s start with a simple problem:
Imagine you have an array a of integers of length n. For the sake of simplicity let&amp;rsquo;s assume it is a one-dimensional array.
You are given 2 values start and finish and your goal is to find a sum of all elements in this array between start and finish.</description>
