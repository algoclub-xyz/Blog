    Title: Hi there folks ðŸ‘‹
    Content: >
      - My name is Alex and I am a software engineer. I really like algorithms and want to improve my english! My very [first post](posts/2022/01/2022-01-18-hello-world-1/) should explain the purpose of this blog better!

      - My team is only a few people large but we are doing our best to keep the content interesting and fresh. Currently we have two periodical rubrics: [Solving Leetcode](tags/solvingleetcode/) and [Grokking Data Structures & Algorithms](tags/datastructures/). We are going to bear with a weekly schedule but, unfortunately, cannot promise it ðŸ˜¢

      - In the meantime, while you're waiting for new articles you can check our other channels. You can find them below.

      - Good luck and keep the spirit!
